            "Are you tired of having to set up your Python coding environment every time you want to create a new coding or data science project? Well, what if there's a better way for you to do this right inside the browser and all that you need is an access to the internet? Well, in this video, I'm going to show you how you could use Google Collab to do that and this will unlock a lot of possibilities. You'll be able to spin up a coding project or data science project very easily with a click of a button. and yeah, let's have a look and let's dive in. So the first thing that you want to do is head over to Cab. Research. Goole.com and this will take you to the welcome to Collab uh page that you have here. Uh, you'll see here on the go that is providing you with instruction on how to access Google's Lrm model called Gemini Um, it tells you the step by step you order to do so as well. So here it summarizes Google Collab as kind of like a coding environment that allows you to write and execute Python right inside the browser. So if you are already familiar with Jupiter notebooks the same thing but then on Google cloud and it's hosted there and great thing is that you'll be able to access this for free. Um, do note that there are also paid options for you if you need more compute power or compute time. Uh, a great thing about the Google C app is that you could get up and running fairly quickly in a few seconds and you'll be also be able to share the resulting notebook to your peers and colleague. So here you'll immediately notice that there's option to include text in your notebook and also the coding aspect in your Uh notebook as well. And you'll notice that this text is stylized by markdown, which is a syntax that allows you to do you know, enter text in here, allow you to stylize it as a boat or Iic um or also allow you to add links to your Uh notebook. And so the coding Cale Here you know is showing an example of creating a map, plot, lib, uh, chart. and so why don't I show you how I would use Google collab. Um, and let's have a look. So to spin up a new notebook, you'll click on the file tab menu here, click on new notebook and drive, and then it'll spin up a new notebook for you. So under the hood is actually a Uh Compute that is spinning up for your use case. So here we're connecting to a remote computer and for the name of the file is actually being stored on your Google Drive. So great thing is, after your coding session, you'll always have access to your code. So even if you close your browser and if the notebook has saved your code, it should be safe in your Google Drive and you you could access that another computer. Uh, which might be handy when you're on the go if you're using your phone, or if you're using your tablet or if you're using your work laptop right? And then when you go home, you have your desktop um or if you go to the office you have your desktop uh which will allow you to act the same uh version if you're using the same uh Google account. All right. So let's give it a name. I'll just call it my first notebook and here you have the option to create a code cell or a text cell. So by default it gives you a coding cell here. So let's click on text and here you're going to see the text cell. It gives you the option to stylize your Um markdown text. So here if you click once, you'll be able to see the heading um with one hash symbol which signifies heading one. So if I want to run this, I'll just you know, hit on shift, enter and then this will run and then you'll see that it is not in the editing mode. it is now in The View mode. Um, if I click on another text cell and then let's have two um heading here. let's run or you could care same as hitting shift and enter same time. and if you click on the table of contents, you'll be able to see the new section here. um Let me give it a name, how about I'll call it my First notebook. Let's delete that. and then you'll see that my my first notebook here is the first item on the Table of contents. Um, you'll notice that the new section here is a sub of the my First notebook. So why don't I create a new one called um examp Example: All right and new section here will be H2 with the two uh two hash symbol. sorry two hash symbol here will signify that it is a H2 heading. and if you have one hash symbol, it is a H1 heading. So what what does H1 H2 mean? It means that heading at Level One subheading at level two, right? So new section here will belong under example section. If you add another to be with triple hash symbols, then this will be H3. Call it like to make it easy for you H2 There you go. So you have one one hash, two hash, three hash and then it'll be displayed hierarchically like that. Um, let me create another section. call it examples. All right. And so in our first example, let's have a look um at using Pandas. So by default, Pandas is already pre-installed in your notebook. So in order to verify that, let's do import pandas as PD and then we'll hit enter All right So it it's able to run without an issue. Um, let's have a look at what if you want to install other Python libraries that might not be in the notebook, what do you do? Okay, so to do that, let me go to this: I think it's YT DLP which is a YouTube video downloader. So like, let's go to the official GitHub repo as well. Um, but before that, um, let's make note of this. Copy it. Okay, Um, so it's actually a lot of code in here. So in order to make it quicker, let me go to a prior notebook. Uh, that I've created uh, using assembly AI the example. So in this video, we pretty much downloaded a YouTube video. All right. And so YT DLP is the name right? So you'll notice here that to use the library, it is called YT Uncore DLP but then to install it, it is yt- DLP. Okay, so note that it's slightly different in spelling. Um, so we want to install it first. So let's skip Panda's example here for a moment. I'll go back to it in a short while. Um, we're adding YT DLP Notice that after we hit on the shift, enter for the text cell. A new coding cell is created automatically. which is quite helpful because we want to type in code now so we want to pip install the YT. Oh, and it pretty much detects that we want to do so as well. So let's run it. You know, either shift, enter or hit on the play button here. And so yeah, you notice that when you're running this, we have this um status here on the RAM and the disk hard drive. uh, consumption. So you'll notice that we have access to a Python 3 environment with almost 13 GB of RAM and more than 100 GB of storage. Um for running your notebook so you could even run a pretty powerful workflow um, using you know your mobile device as well. Now that we have YT DLP installed, let's have a look at some of the code here. We'll copy this code block and then paste it in here. Then we'll run it. It runs successfully in 1 seconds and let's copy the out here, pasted and then run the function here. And it's suggesting us to do this following: I'll just hit on Tab and I'll run it shift, enter or just click on play button. You'll see that the file is being downloaded from YouTube which is the video on Steve Jobs 2005 Stanford commencement address. Um, so it's being downloaded so it's still loading. Give it a short moment. In the meantime, we'll go here to the files and it's downloading so you'll see the files are being created here. Um, reload. Okay, so without even reloading, it updates in a short moment. So the intermediate file was deleted and then the final file was here. If you click on rename, you'll be able to see the I use the arrow key and then you'll be able to see the full name right there. So we've downloaded the MP3 file, which is the audio of the video here. All righty. So this workflow runs correctly for the YT DLP Uh folder. I mean Python Library. Now let's run Pandas So you'll notice here in the file section. we have a sample data folder. Um, and if you here, you'll be able to see that there's several CSV data sets in here for you to play around with. Um, let's load in a CSV file. so we want to type in PD. Uh, let's do that before let's type in DF because we want to assign it to a DF variable. And yes, that's essentially what we're going to do. Pd. read CSV So if you see the suggestion and if you want to run the same code, you could just hit on Tab and then it'll autoc complete for you. All right. And then we'll just have to rename the CSV name so it is in the sample data folder. type in Sample data slash and then it's suggesting. Okay, let's use the housing set tab. enter I'll type in DF so that we could you know, see the resulting data frame and then I'll use head command so that we see the first few lines of the Uh data frame. So this is our data frame. and let me show you another feature which is pretty neat. Uh, which is kind of like a IDE Um integrated development environment. Uh, that you might use like Py charm. Um, or if you are a R user uh, you might be familiar with R Studio Uh which has the ability to show you the variables that is currently in memory. So you see here that we have the URL variable in memory which was created just a moment ago and we have the DF variable in memory. So the shape of the URL variable is it is 43 characters in length Um and the shape of the DF variable is that it is a tuple of the values 3,000 and the second value is n. So what are those values? Let's have a look. If you type in DF do shape, you'll be able to see the same values which is essentially 3,000 rows and nine columns. So the nine columns are here: Longitude, latitude, housing, median, AG Etc until the last column. So this is using pandas in here. What about how about a machine learning library? Py could learn. So let's click on the getting started or actually just go to classification. Example: Um is a random Forest Example: Yes, Click on this Cont: So I'm currently under the examples heading here. so I'll add a new H2 heading, I'll call it Pyit Learn enter and then I'll paste code. So we're generating a data set and then we're assigning it to the X and Y variables. Then we're creating a classifier using the Psyit Learn Um. Here we're using the gradient boosting classifier and then we're specifying the number of estimators to be 100 and the learning rate to be 1.0 Also, the math step to be 1 and then we're using the random state of zero and then we're creating a model by using the fit command and then as input we're using X and Y variables X is the independent variable, Y is the dependent variable, and we're training a classifier which can then be used to make a prediction. But in this specific example, we're actually displ the feature importance meaning that for the nine variables, that no, not not not that Um data set, but then for the Uh variables here in this particular demo example, which of the variable are influencing the model um, the most Um meaning which are the important features for making predictions of the Y variable. Okay, so this is an example for the psychic Learn: Um. A point of note here is that you'll see that Psych To Learn is already pre-installed in the notebook. so you'll see also that Google Collab allows you to be up and running Uh using Collab Um to import you know typically used libraries like Numpy Panda Second Learn also out Uh for data visualization. Um, So do note here that you know sometimes when you want to use a Python library and to install that Library it might have a different name, right? So if you're doing this locally, uh, you might be confused on the naming part. um as I already mentioned on. like the YT DLP Library you'll notice that to use it, you'll have the underscore version, but then to install it, you'll have to use the dash version. Uh, pyit learn is quite similar where when you want to use the library, it's called SK Learn. However, if you want to install it, you'll use pip install and then s kit learn like that. Okay, um so if you want to update a particular Library, you could also do so. um, by adding this update um parameter here. just a poy note. Or if you want to use other like nightly versions of Python libraries which are typically available. Um, so you're always using The Cutting Edge libraries. but be aware that there might be bugs in the the newest Library version. Uh, because it might not have been tested. So let's see if we want could create some out here. Let's create some data visualization. Um here out here is one of my favorite. Uh, let's create a heat map so you'll copy the code here. Go back to the notebook. I'll create a new section here. over to you know the SE the area where you want to create the new section. Click on text and then it'll add. Um say out here shift enter Um, Do note that if you want to move your sell up or down, you could just do so by hovering on the cell and then you know clicking up or down. Okay So this will allow you the flexibility to move specific sections up or down um in your notebook and this will be reflected in the table of content. Well paste the code shift, enter to run or hit on the play button and then we have the heat map. Um, here let's have a look at the Stacked area charts. Let's do the same copy and then we'll paste it here. All right there you go. So is here and you could also add description of the chart. You know this is the heat map. you know at text descriptive right? Here's how to create a heat map and if you'd like to add an section to it or just make it bold, you could. you could do it like well. Um, you can B So it doesn't necessarily have to be a section. Um, However, if you want to make it a section see this is H2 You can make map H3 So let's do that. You could have you know 1, 2, three and then heat. Add three and then you call it that. Enter H Okay, now before I saw it was underneath. Um, but it hasn't updated but now it's working properly out here. Learn you know for this one, you know you could have other examp examples um underneath this as well by just adding H3 headings in there. Um, you'll see how easy it is To you know, go through the documentation of uh, the libraries that you want to use and then copy pasting it into your notebook and then you could modify it to your own. You know preference in here. Let's have a look at other features in the Uh Notebook. So what if we want to install a library or a package that is not Pip install? You know you know with Pip install it allows you to install Python libraries. But what if you need packages from the operating system? Um, So do note that the notebook is being run on a Ubuntu Linux operating system. So let's say that in a prior tutorial here, we needed to use the Ffmpeg package Um which is you know available on the OS of You2 So you want to copy here? Um, let's just paste it underneath the Ytdl P It's kind of like a prerequisite, right? So you need to enter the Um exclamation mark here. It's kind of like an escape character that tells Collab that you want to install Um, you want to use the following command as the operating system commands, right? How? It's exactly the same thing as how you would do if you open up your terminal line and then you enter Um commands for the operating. So here we app get install and then the FFM Peg So hit here or just shift. enter. And now we've installed the Um Yunu package, fmeg. all right now. it's available in your notebook so you could think of this as kind of like your mini computer. You have access to the underlying Uh resources so you could install packages from the OS. You could also um, you know, install Python libraries that you might need for your project. Uh, Another handy thing is the you know the secrets management here. So you see that I have a lot of Um example of API Keys already in here. So why don't we have a look? Let's say that I want to create an open AI API key? so log into your API Um provider platform, whichever it may be open. AI Anthropic Assembly AI 11 Labs Um, there's so many right? So here let's see. click on settings and then you'll go to API Keys Uh, these are the previously created API keys that I have already done. So I'll create a new one by go hovering to the right aspect. um I mean up the panel here. click on create new secret key. um I'll call this dummy API key. Um, don't worry I'll delete this after the tutorial overover. back to the secrets part here. Um, and then let me replace this that me Okay, I'll and place it in here. toggle here and then it'll you know hide math the actual value. Uh, to activate the API key of choice, you could just toggle on. you know the variable of your interest. you could do multiple toggles as well. right? For this, you know. example: I Just toggle on the dummy key and to actually call the dummy key into your environment of the notebook, you want to add this Um code snippet in there. You could either copy this into memory or you could here to add the code cell. So we'll add the code cell here and then we'll go back to the table of content mode. see where did it added the cell? Okay, it it added right here. So I'll move this uh to the top so over here and then click on the Move cell up. You could also use the you know the keyboard shortcut here: I I'll just click on the button. we'll move it up. Panda Samp This all right. and now replace text the actual dummy key here. name, dummy key okay, set. I'll also have to assign a variable to it. so I I'll call it dummy. API key equals this value. shift enter and it'll be in memory. Now we'll be able to assign this to the API parameter of your Um Python Library of Choice. So if you're using Open AI or if you're using replicate, um, be sure to add this variable here that you just created as the value for your Um API parameter. Okay, this is very convenient for storing the API key so that you don't have to, You know, copy paste the API key um and then run it explicitly. um in the notebook which is not safe so you could store it you know in memory and then you could toggle whenever needed. Okay, so I'll go back. And uh Delete the key here. Delete key, Roke it. All righty. So I think covered a lot in this tutorial. Um, do note that if you want to use your notebook in your mobile phone, let me let me show you here. it's running on my iPhone Um, right. So yeah, so you you could definitely code this while traveling if you're on a train, if you're on an airplane, and if you have internet access of course you'll be able to you know, work on on your coding. um, projects. Um, make some minor edit to your uh notebook. Um, it might be a bit challenging to you know. Type full on code in there. and yeah, I Hope this video was helpful to you. Please drop a comment in the comment section of what other tutorial videos that you'd like me to make. And yeah, if you reach this far, please drop a fire Emoji in the comment section so that I know that you have already watched to this section. and yeah, greatly appreciate that. And yeah, I mean the best way to learn data science is to do data science and please enjoy the journey.\n"
